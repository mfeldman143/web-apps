## Welcome to Michael Feldman's GitHub Pages

Michael Feldman specializes in data engineering, Big Data, and databases. With a focus on cloud architecture since 2018 and prior experience in database engineering, Michael has consulted for diverse sectors including public institutions, Johnson and Johnson, and Stanford University's Climate Change initiatives. Additionally, Michael explores Full Stack development, showcased by the following projects. During his tenure at Stanford University as a Staff Research Software Engineer, Michael instructed CS199 and CS399, guiding both undergraduate and graduate students over seven quarters. His work primarily concentrated on developing the 14MM database and the METER platform: [meter-ai.web.app](https://meter-ai.web.app). Thank you for visiting—have a great day!
